# Changelog

All notable changes to the engineering-toolkit (`etk`) plugin will be documented in this file.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-06-14 — first open-source release

Engineering-practices toolkit: ADR, TDD, code review, quality gates, brainstorming, Sentry investigation, and workflow orchestration. 23 skills, 4 agents, 19 commands.

### Highlights

- **`/etk:review-mr` + `/etk:post-mr-comments` support both GitLab MRs and GitHub PRs.** Reviews fan out to domain-aware agents, then post inline-anchored comments via `glab` (`/discussions`) or `gh` (`pulls/{N}/comments`), with an out-of-hunk top-level fallback and anchor verification. See `code-review-playbook` for the per-VCS recipes.
- MIT licensed.

_First public release at 2.7.0; earlier version history was internal and has been omitted._
